Exercise: Practicing with functions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your task in this exercise is to code a function which will be able to take a word and locate the position of a chosen letter in that given word.  

Task 1:
Write a function named letterFinder that accepts two parameters: word and match.

Task 2:
Code a 'for' loop inside the function's body. The for loop's counter should start at zero, increment by 1 on each iteration and exit when the counter variable's value is equal to the length of the word parameter.

Task 3:
Add an if statement inside the for loop whose condition works as follows:

 Access each of the letters inside the passed in word using the counter variable, with word[i]. 

Check if the current word[i] is equal to the value of match.

Task 4:
console.log the following inside the body of the if statement: console.log('Found the', match, 'at', i).

Task 5:
Write the else condition. Here you'll just console log the following: console.log('---No match found at', i).

Task 6:
Call the letterFinder and pass it as its first argument as the string "test" and as its second argument, the string "t".

Your output should be the following:

Found the t at 0

---No match found at 1

---No match found at 2

Found the t at 3

Exercise: Creating arrays and objects

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise lab you will practice creating arrays and objects.

Tasks to complete:

- Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.

- Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.

- Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.

- Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.

- Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.

- Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.

- Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.

- Using the dot notation, assign a covertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.

- Use the console to log the entire favCar object.
